#QUESTION1
# Transform population using the log10 transformation and save to object log10_population
log10_population<- log10(murders$population)
# Transform total gun murders using log10 transformation and save to object log10_total_gun_murders
log10_total_gun_murders <- log10(murders$total)
# Create a scatterplot with the log scale transformed population and murders 
plot(log10_population, log10_total_gun_murders)

#QUESTION2
