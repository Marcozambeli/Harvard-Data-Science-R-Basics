#QUESTION1
# Create a numeric vector to store the temperatures listed in the instructions into a vector named temp
# Make sure to follow the same order in the instructions
temp <- c(35, 88, 42, 84, 81, 30)

#QUESTION2
# Create a character vector called city to store the city names
# Make sure to follow the same order as in the instructions
city <- c("Beijing", "Lagos", "Paris", "Rio de Janeiro", "San Juan", "Toronto")

#QUESTION3
# Associate the temperature values with its corresponding city
names(temp) <- city

#QUESTION4
# temperatures of the first three cities in the list:
temp[1:3]

#QUESTION5
# Access the temperatures of Paris and San Juan
temp[c(3,5)]

#QUESTION6
# Create a vector x of integers that starts at 12 and ends at 73.
x <- 12:73
# Determine the length of object x.
length(x)

#QUESTION7
# Create a vector containing all the positive odd numbers smaller than 100.
# The numbers should be in ascending order
seq(1, 99, 2)

#QUESTION8
# Create a sequence of numbers from 6 to 55, with 4/7 increments and determine its length
length(seq(6, 55, 4/7))

#QUESTION9
# Store the sequence in the object a
a <- seq(1, 10, length.out = 100)

# Determine the class of a
class(a)

#QUESTION10
# Store the sequence in the object a
a <- seq(1, 10)

# Determine the class of a
class(a)

#QUESTION11
# Confirm the class of 1L is integer
class(1L)

#QUESTION12
# Redefine `x` to typecast it to get an integer vector using `as.numeric`.
# You will get a warning but that is okay
x <- as.numeric(x)
