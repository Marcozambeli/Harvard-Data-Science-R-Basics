#QUESTION1
# Store the `murder_rate < 1` in `low` 
low <- murder_rate < 1
low

#QUESTION2
# Get the indices of entries that are below 1
which(low)

#QUESTION3
# Names of states with murder rates lower than 1
murders$state[low]

#QUESTION4
# Create a vector ind for states in the Northeast and with murder rates lower than 1. 
nw <- murders$region == "Northeast"
ind <- low & nw #ou low & murders$region == "Northeast"
# Names of states in `ind` 
murders$state[ind]

#QUESTION5
# Compute the average murder rate using `mean` and store it in object named `avg`
avg <- mean(murder_rate)
# How many states have murder rates below avg ? Check using sum 
sum(murder_rate < avg)

#QUESTION6
# Store the 3 abbreviations in a vector called `abbs` (remember that they are character vectors and need quotes)
abbs <- c("AK", "MI", "IA")
# Match the abbs to the murders$abb and store in ind
ind <- match(abbs, murders$abb)
# Print state names from ind
murders$state[ind]

#QUESTION7
# Store the 5 abbreviations in `abbs`. (remember that they are character vectors
abbs <- c("MA", "ME", "MI", "MO", "MU")
# Use the %in% command to check if the entries of abbs are abbreviations in the the murders data frame
abbs%in%murders$abb

#QUESTION8
# Use the `which` command and `!` operator to find out which index abbreviations are not actually part of the dataset and store in `ind`
ind <- which(!abbs%in%murders$abb)
# Names of abbreviations in `ind`
abbs[ind]
