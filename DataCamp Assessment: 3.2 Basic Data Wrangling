#QUESTION1
# Redefine murders so that it includes a column named rate with the per 100,000 murder rates
murders <- mutate(murders, rate = total/population*100000)

#QUESTION2
# Redefine murders to include a column named rank
# with the ranks of rate from highest to lowest
murders <- mutate(murders, rank = rank(-rate))

#QUESTION3
# Use select to only show state names and abbreviations from murders
select(murders, state, abb)

#QUESTION4
# Filter to show the top 5 states with the highest murder rates
filter(murders, rank <= 5)

#QUESTION5
# Use filter to create a new data frame no_south
no_south <- filter(murders, region != "South")
# Use nrow() to calculate the number of rows
nrow(no_south)

#QUESTION6
# Create a new data frame called murders_nw with only the states from the northeast and the west
murders_nw <- filter(murders, region %in% c("Northeast", "West"))
# Number of states (rows) in this category 
nrow(murders_nw)

#QUESTION7
# Create a table, call it my_states, that satisfies both the conditions 
my_states <- filter(murders, rate < 1 & region %in% c("Northeast", "West"))
# Use select to show only the state name, the murder rate and the rank
select(my_states, state, rate, rank)

#QUESTION8
# show the result and only include the state, rate, and rank columns, all in one line, in that order
filter(murders, region %in% c("Northeast", "West") & rate < 1) %>% select(state, rate, rank)

#QUESTION9
# Create new data frame called my_states (with specifications in the instructions)
my_states <- murders %>% mutate(rate = total/population*100000, rank = rank(-rate)) %>% filter(region %in% c("Northeast", "West") & rate < 1) %>% select(state, rate, rank)
